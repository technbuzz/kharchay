## Attention

I have so much in my mind to take this app further. But as this app is reference for many of my articlea based on Ionic 3. I want to freeze this app in a moment. Hence forth this project is archived

## Other Workarounds

I did thought of creating a seperate branch or any other solution using exiating repo. But this would make it different to bring people on board.

## Other Reasons

- I wanted to move current app to Ionic 4 which will have a lot of breaking changes. Which is not possible with the current project and considering its demand. I have ported the next version in to it own repo. 2.0 if you will.
